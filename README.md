# NVOnline - A PHP Project

This is a simple website project that shows good books to read mostly web novels or of a similar type.

## Installation or Requirements 
- A server running PHP and MySql(XAMPP/LAMP or MAMP{I use XAMPP}).
-Download the file and put it in the folder :
>xampp/htdocs
- Please check the ==db_conn.ph== file for your own database config.



## Usage
- When you run the server go to your browser go to:

> localhost/NVOnline
- Due to this being MVC you have to navigate to /view to actually work

- The website should be running. Then you can sign up as you follow the buttons such as login/sign up.

- Has a search, details and a reader page added

- Will extend more functionalities later.
